DESCRIPTION:Using mock data in ABAP Unit Test with SAP Standard tools\nHazzle: Unit test for code that uses SAP function modules\, where you want to make sure that data is posted correctly by SAP.\nOften you have to use SAP BAPIs & Friends to post your changed business data.\nIn those cases it does not help to mock SAP as this is the core of the test.\nI'd like to show\, how to make use of a constant fake database for unit test in development clients using SAP standard tools.\n
