DESCRIPTION:ABAP File Formats by Albert Mink and Lars Hvam\nABAP development objects are usually stored in the database of an ABAP system. However\, there are different use cases for the cross-system export and import of ABAP development objects as files\, for example\, for using file-based tools such as ADT and for versioning in Git with abapGit or gCTS. Such external versioning also enables various decentralized development processes. What if there was a common file representation for each ABAP development object that can be used for all these use cases? What are the most important aspects of this file representation? And why is this interesting for us as ABAP developers? Let's talk about ABAP file formats... https://github.com/sap/abap-file-formats\n
